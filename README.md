# IoT-driven-Artefact-Conservation

The history of humankind has always been a good teacher, as shown by the fact that people learn
from their mistakes. Learning about the history of a country is made much easier via the study of
its national heritage. As a direct consequence of this, these intangible cultural artefacts get a
prominent level of attention.
The challenge of effectively preserving the works of art shown at museums and galleries, while
maintaining a low level of energy usage is one that is of the utmost importance. It is a responsibility
that we owe to both the current and the next generation. When these artefact collections are not
adequately managed, they are vulnerable to the effects of severe environmental conditions.
Because of this, it is very necessary to always keep a close eye on the climatic conditions, whether
it be in storage or during displays.
The preservation of artefacts is significantly impacted by the degree to which environmental
elements such as brightness, temperature, and humidity are controlled and managed. Due to the
widespread use of new digital technologies, the recording, storing, and showing of cultural heritage
assets have become more dependable and cost-effective.
By using a Wireless Sensing and Monitoring Platform that is made possible by the Internet of
Things (IoT), we can monitor the temperature, relative humidity, and light in the setting of
museums and artefacts. This enables us to better preserve and protect these important collections.
The use of an IoT driven monitoring system, as opposed to the conventional measuring tools and
techniques that are utilised in art galleries, may assist in the undertaking of measurements in a
manner that is continuous, on a real-time basis, as well as in a manner that is much simpler and
more cost-effective. The newly created technology is capable of automatically adjusting the light
intensity surrounding the artefact to the appropriate range. The Android application not only tracks
temperature and humidity but also has the capability to manually adjust the level of light intensity.
